    <h3>
        As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. <span class="underline">I felt deeply moved, and stirred. 
        It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure</span>. <span class="highlight">It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span> 
        In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: 
        <span class="text-red">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible . . ."</span>
        As his lips opened slightly, with suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: <span class="text-red">"What moves me
        so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower-- the image of a rose that shines through his whole
        beng like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</span> And I felt him to be more fragile still.<span class="underline"> I felt the need of protecting him, as if 
        he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</span>
